If the LLM returns \"twenty-five\", Pydantic will throw a validation error, which LangChain uses to prompt the LLM to retry.\n",

For chat models, as the one we are using, this can take the form of a sequence of pairs, where each pair consists of an input and the response messages, demonstrating desired behaviors. However, creating such examples is not that easy as it is the case with 'regular' few-shot prompting, when tool calling is not involved. Here is why:\n",

    "To produce structured output, the LLM we use depends, under-the-hood, on tool calling. This typically involves the generation of an AI message (one or more) containing tool calls, as well as tool messages (one or more, depending on the number of tools used) containing the results of tool calls. How exactly these messages are generated and in what order depends on the model provider (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Groq, ...).\n",

      "Food 5/5\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "shawarma is not tasty. need to improve in taste\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Ambience was great.. food was good too.. service was pretty fast.. drinks were as I expected.. Pradhan was my appointed guy and he was very respectful and fast in delivering my orders..\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Ask anyone what you like about Hyderabad the most, the answer is always Food! Hyderabadi food has played a pivotal role in making the city one of the most culturally diverse cities in India! Irrespective of which state you are and kind of palate you have, Hyderabadi food will make its way to your heart with its rich generous flavors! But where to eat in Hyderabad? As an ardent foodie, I get this question asked, all the time. So to my non-Hyderabadi friends I have always been recommending legendary Irani restaurants for Biryani and or any Hyderabadi dish. Because i believe the true flavors of a region are found in its oldest lanes!\n",
      "\n",
      "But that has changed now. Thanks to the unstoppable pace at which the city is growing, even the legacy restaurants have adapted to the change because of the loved showered on them by the urban population. Now a corporate techie doesn't have to travel all the way to the old city to taste an authentic Biryani. The legendary outlets are expanding themselves to every part of the city where they see the love for them! In the last 5-7 years, some oldest names have made a never-before effort to step out of their comfort old city zone and entered the Cyberabad area.\n",
      "\n",
      "One such new entrant is Hyderabadi Dawat. It is not a legendary name but the people that are running it are definitely lived this cuisine! And its evident in their authentic Hyderabadi food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hyderabadi Daawat is located at Gachibowli-Kondapur road. It is a beautiful family dining restaurant with an elegant and royal ambiance. Just how Hyderabadis like it! The menu, as expected, looks as if taken straight out of a Nawabi Hyderabadi Wedding reception!\n",
      "\n",
      "We were invited to try their exquisite food on a weekday evening! We started with a Mutton based shorba which was perfect in taste but could have been a little thicker!\n",
      "\n",
      " The starters started with Achari Paneer Tikka which was surprisingly good. Though not their forte, it had perfect Taste and softness! The veg Shami was another great starter! The only veg blogger amongst us was so happy to experience the unexpected!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came the first non-veg starter, the Murgh Kalmi Kebab! Chicken Thighs marinated and then char-grilled to perfection. It had a gooey texture that probably came from the ghee! It was an amazing starter with a great aroma and succulent chicken!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came Seekh kebab, something i am very critical about. Because most of them get it wrong with unnecessary spices and artificial colors! But this one at Hyderabadi Daawat made me feel like home! It had the perfect Hyderabadi taste and the meat was fresh and succulent. Had a proper Seekh Kebab after a long time!\n",
      "\n",
      "Tandoori Jhinga was just good! Nothing great but then no flaws either!\n",
      "\n",
      "Their special feature of the evening were three great delicacies!\n",
      "\n",
      "The first one was the Sikandari Raan, a whole lamb leg marinated with whole spices and then char-grilled and topped with dry fruits! It was one hell of a royal dish! But the meat could have been cooked more. In fact, to a fall-off-the-bone level.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second khaas peshkash was Chelo Kebab Platter! A Persian delicacy that consists of Rice, a Seekh kebab and other kebabs beautifully arranged on a platter! This dish was so beautifully plated, we didn't want to disturb it and just keep clicking it! Nevertheless, the kebab was soft, succulent and full of flavours. Not very spicy though!\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, it was time for the king of them all, the Murgh Musallam. A Mughlai masterpiece wherein a whole chicken bird is stuffed with minced meat, boiled eggs. Then marinated with curd and lot of spices and grilled. It is then topped with a thick gravy which gives it a whole new flavor. See the pics and decide for yourself!\n",
      "\n",
      "That was our Nawabi Hyderabadi Daawat at this royal restaurant!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm glad the Hyderabadi Cuisine is now going fine dine!\n",
      "\n",
      "Take my word, Hyderabadi Daawat serves, authentic Hyderabadi food!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Had visited this place after a friends recommendation and what a experience!! Wee visited in the evening hours so we're not that hungry just wanted a quick bite. Tried their chicken momo and pork ribs.. both of them were extremely delicious and cooked to perfection. We also tried there summer time mocktail but initially it was served under room temperature, after requesting them the add on some ice it tastes fine.\n",
      "We would loved the place and would visit again soon.\n",
      "Thankyou :)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "One of the first thing that one would notice as soon as you enter in this cafe is the sense of nostalgia with old school themed pictures and walls which makes for a great ambience. The food here is also very good, specially pasta sandwich and mava cake are must try.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "If there was zero stars then i could have given that, never order food from here, the chicken which they have served was completely stale, the rotis was cold. Very much poor experience !!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Very nice & well mannered\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

The food is average in quality. The service is also quite average for the price what they charge. Not going to visit anytime in the future\",\n          \"I went to club rouge since the day it started,I have been to this place more than 150 times.It was like a hangout place for us to always go.It was beautiful in the starting,less crowd and only couples were allowed to dance floors and people dint stand on tables and all that time to dance.Bouncers were pretty good at that time and the manager at that time was also very nice and polite.In the past few months since the manager changed,his name is siddharth the club rougue we knew was no more there.This angry little manager is the worst human u could ecer talk to.Single girls beware to go to this place.They allow cheap bastards into the club who doesn't drink and doesn't even have a table,they keep roaming all around the club to find girls and talk with them or make em uncomfy by staring at them and not moving from there table.I even saw a guy putting a tablet into some girls drink.Coming to my incident,Yesterday i went to this place to watch afternoon ipl match which was at 4.We went there at 5 and it was happy hours,which we don know or never cared about happy hours in clubs.We started watching match and at 6 a waiter comes saying pls pay bill since happy hours is ended.We said okay and we paid.Now the waiter says please leave, we were like wtf we came to watch the match and we will leave only after it's done.Then he calls the manager.His name is SIDDHARTH.This guy is one horrible crap who thinks since he is the manager of the club he's an avenger superhero.He came to us and said which a very tone u people have to leave,I told that's not happening we are hyderabadi's and it's srh match and we will leave only when it's done and he started shouting and telling no with so much attitude.Later he said 30mins and left.He wasn't coming when I was calling him also.He comes after 30mins and says go,When we told we will not leave until the match is done he told he will call bouncers and make us leave,We were so frustrated and angry we told call them and let them decide who's wrong here.Then he told that club rougue owner(MD) is NARSINGH RAO and he is a big local goon and he threatened us that once u leave this place some unknown people will come and hit and break our bones if we say anything to SIDDHARTH (the manager).People go to clubbing to have fun and in the end all we got was a life threat.And moreover this place became a sick place,it stinks and waiters will force u to give more tip saying 2 ppl served u and all.And the cheap guy stags who come inside with influence and think they are hottest models \\ud83d\\ude02.Sorry for the long review but i think they deserve it.The manager SIDDHARTH.SIDDHARTH.SIDDHARTH Thanks for making me realize that i should never come back to club rougue and make bills around 20k each time I visit the club.And thanks for making me realize that I should not suggest this place to anyone.His name is SIDDHARTH and the he is HERO of club rougue.\",\n          \"I didnt
