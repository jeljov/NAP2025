    "\n",
    "**Few shot learning** is a form of machine learning where a model is taught to perform a particular task, such as classification or named entity recognition, by being provided with a few examples only, instead of a large training set, as is the case in 'traditional' machine learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "As any other task based on large languge models (LLMs), few shot learning relies on the use of appropriate prompts. LangChain offers prompt template classes specifically built for few shot learning, which we will use to classify a set of software requirements into functional and non-functional.\n",

    "Note: there is also **zero-shot learning**, where the model is asked to performe a specific task without any examples being given, only guidance / instruction in natural language (prompt).\n",
