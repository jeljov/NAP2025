    "\n",
    "[LangExtract](https://github.com/google/langextract/) is a Python library that uses LLMs to extract structured information from unstructured text documents based on user-defined instructions, in particular, a user-defined prompt and a few examples illustrating the kind of information that is to be extracted.\n",

    "Like the previous information extraction (IE) approach we explored (in week 7), this one is also based on the user's instructions (prompt). However, unlike the previous IE approach that was based on (annotated) data schema, this approach relies on an example (one or more) of the data to be extracted."
